# Exawatt Architecture

Exawatt is a command interface for managing agent fleets across local, hosted, and third-party harnesses.

The architecture is source-agnostic: local OpenClaw, hosted OpenClaw, Codex, Claude Code, custom harnesses, and Demo Harnesses all sit behind explicit Agent Source / Harness boundaries.

## Layers

### UI Layer

User-facing surfaces:

- Electron desktop app
- Next.js web app
- `/fleet`
- `/dashboard` and `/board` legacy demo surfaces
- `/architecture` public architecture map
- future public `/docs` guides

### Coordination and Intelligence Layer

Canonical product objects:

- Workspace
- Initiative
- Agent
- Session
- Decision
- Approval
- Event
- Artifact
- Consumption
- Context Signal
- Secret / Credential
- Agent Source / Harness
- Gateway
- Policy / Budget

This layer should hide source-specific plumbing from the UI.

This layer also owns translation, durable decisions, context signals, policies, budgets, approvals, and consumption records.

### Agent Infrastructure Layer

Provider/runtime boundaries:

- Agent Source / Harness adapters
- local OpenClaw gateway
- remote OpenClaw gateway
- Codex / Claude Code adapters
- Demo Harness / Demo Scenario Source
- custom harnesses
- local machine
- Supabase
- Electron main/preload process
- hosted VPS instances, starting with Hetzner
- hosted Exawatt control plane

The UI should depend on normalized Exawatt concepts, not raw provider-specific payloads.

## Object Model

`/architecture` uses the canonical nouns from `docs/product/concepts.md`:

- Workspace
- Initiative
- Agent
- Session
- Event
- Artifact
- Consumption
- Decision
- Context Signal
- Secret / Credential
- Agent Source / Harness
- Gateway
- Policy / Budget
- Approval

## Current Implementation

Built:

- Next.js app shell
- Electron shell
- Supabase auth/data
- legacy Supabase demo task flow
- `@exawatt/core` OpenClaw JSON-RPC client, adapters, FleetManager, and MockFleetTransport
- `/fleet` live/mock fleet UI
- `/fleet/cron`

Partial:

- Electron local runtime integration
- source/harness abstraction beyond OpenClaw/mock
- architecture overview as a living map

Planned:

- Initiative model
- scoped Decision model
- Context Signals
- Consumption and spend controls
- secrets/configuration strategy
- hosted OpenClaw / remote harnesses
- multi-source fleet aggregation

## Architecture Map

`/architecture` is rendered from `src/lib/architecture/manifest.ts`. Keep that manifest in sync with this document and the roadmap.

## Documentation Contract

See `AGENTS.md`. Product, architecture, roadmap, and decision docs are live system state and must be updated with relevant changes.
